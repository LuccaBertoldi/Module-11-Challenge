# Module-11-Challenge Note Taker
## Description

This note taker is a back end and front end application running together. When you click on the button on the first page you are taken to another page where you can add the title and the content of your note. I had really hard time with this application and making it work, I tried watching videos and doing research, but even with this I wasnt able to make it run completely, when I added some coding the buttos from the notes.html disapperared and I wasnt able make it show again.
